# Functional Programming in Scala
My answers to the exercises in [Functional Programming in Scala](http://manning.com/bjarnason/) published by
[Manning](http://manning.com). It has its own [github repo](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) with the official
answers in it, so if you're determined to cheat on your homework I advise you to go there instead.
